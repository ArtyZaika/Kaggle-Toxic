Kaggle Toxic Challenge

Big thanks to all the kernels authors, from whom I took some of the models (like Capsule GRU).
And thanks to authors of the Attention layers, [AttentionWithContext](https://gist.github.com/cbaziotis/7ef97ccf71cbc14366835198c09809d2), [DeepMoji](https://github.com/bfelbo/DeepMoji)
and 3rd one, which I cannot find at the moment.

Single models score around 0.9852-53.
There's a notebook for stacking both with GBM's and MLP's + K-Fold or bagging run pipeline.
